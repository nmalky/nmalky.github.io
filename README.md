## 2022-07-27 - creativity is hard.
Today I ???
- finished watching lecture 0 of @rwxrob/boost
- backed up another computer over ssh with reference to https://jstaf.github.io/2018/03/12/backups-with-borg-rsync.html
- configured an archlinux vm on which to develop (and write this). Networking was painful as it required both modifying `/etc/systemd/network/20-ethernet.network` and adding routes with `ip route` in the installer -- then doing the same after install.
- invoked `localectl set-x11-keymap gb caps:esc`
- installed `tldr` to get quick examples from man pages
- installed github-cli (`gh`) 

In the near future I would like to
- use this installation to participate in robotics volunteering
- set up a VPS for experimentation
- build more presence here.

I am very self-conscious of what I put here. Perhaps a pseudonym would allow for more expression, though my initial perception is that there really isn't very much of worth to express.
